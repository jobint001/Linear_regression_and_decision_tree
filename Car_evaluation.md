# Decision Tree Classifier Analysis on Car Evaluation Dataset

## Introduction

This analysis explores the use of a decision tree classifier on the car evaluation dataset. The goal is to predict a car's acceptability based on several attributes such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, persons it can carry, the size of the luggage boot, and safety. The decision tree's performance is evaluated based on different tree depths and minimum samples split, offering insights into how these parameters influence model accuracy.

## Data Preparation

The car evaluation dataset comprises multiple features: 'buying', 'maint', 'doors', 'persons', 'lug_boot', 'safety', and a target variable 'class'. Initial data checks confirmed no missing values, and categorical variables were encoded using ordinal encoding to prepare the dataset for modeling.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the decision tree classifier's performance. The decision tree was initially trained using the "entropy" criterion. The model's accuracy was assessed on both the training and testing sets to understand its performance and generalization capability.

## Tuning Tree Depth and Min Samples Split

### Exploring Tree Depth

The impact of varying the tree depth was analyzed to understand its effect on model accuracy. A deeper tree might capture more information but risks overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

### Adjusting Min Samples Split

Similarly, adjusting the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (`min_samples_split`) was explored. This parameter helps control overfitting by requiring a minimum number of samples in a node before considering it for a split.

## Insights and Conclusions

The analysis revealed that both tree depth and min samples split significantly influence the decision tree classifier's accuracy. A balance must be struck to avoid overfitting while maintaining a high level of predictive performance.

- A moderate tree depth and a reasonable threshold for min samples split tend to yield the best results, balancing between underfitting and overfitting.
- Visualizing the decision tree helps in understanding the model's decision-making process and identifying potential areas of improvement.

## Future Directions

Further research could explore more sophisticated techniques like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to improve predictive performance and robustness against overfitting.
